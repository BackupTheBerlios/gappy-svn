        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

        <p>The Group Appointment Calendar for Python aims to provide a mechanism for
        students to schedule demo appointments with instructors. Teachers or TAs make
        a list of times for which they are available, and then students in groups sign
        up to come to a given appointment.</p>

        <h2 id="major_features">Major Features</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>Students can be formed into groups that set up a single appointment time</li>
        <li>Data can be stored in any SQL-compliant database back-end to provide
        reliability and interoperability with third-party clients</li>
        <li>Web-based front-end ensures universal accessibility from anywhere on
        campus</li>
        <li>Low system requirements ensure that even junked PCs  can be used as a host</li>
        <li>Python-powered core using the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php" title="Berkeley System Design License">Django</a> framework for fast development
        and easy extendibility</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="design_goals">Design Goals</h2>

        <p>Because this is an instructional product, we have a slightly different focus
        than normal. Our primary design goal is <strong>keep it simple</strong>. This is not a
        programming course, but rather an opportunity to get involved in and launch an
        open-source project. As such, stay focused on the learning and not on the
        feature set. The other primary goal for this product is to make the product as
        easy-to-use as possible. This may well mean eschewing features in favor of
        simple, straightforward design and user interface. That's a good thing. Enjoy
        it.</p>

        <h2 id="case_study_dr_jablowme">Case Study: Dr. Jablowme</h2>

        <p>Dr. Jablowme is a professor of occult studies at Duke University. For his OS
        118 course, students are required to analyze the internals of the Windows XP
        kernel, and, leveraging what they learned in class about conjuring demons from
        beyond the grave, cause a copy of Windows to materialize spontaneously in thin
        air. This demonstration must be performed in front of Dr. Jablowme during a
        period of his day when he is available to deal with the "Lesser Minds" of
        undergraduate students. To enable students to do this, Dr. Jablowme sits
        himself in front of his Apple Macintosh LC III, fires up Netscape Navigator
        3.2, and navigates to the site where his department's copy of GAPPy is housed.</p>

        <p>Upon reaching the site, Dr. Jablowme is asked for a username and password. He
        dutifully types in BUFFY and TOH_OS_SI, respectively, then clicks "Login."
        In a moment, he is presented with his main screen. It is divided into three
        columns. In the rightmost column is a list of all upcoming appointments
        scheduled in the system for the next three days, along with which class and
        assignment it is for. Slots that he has made himself available for that are
        not yet full are also listed as being reserved but open. Clicking on any of
        these appointments or reserved times would take him to a screen where he could
        reopen the appointment (meaning that students would lose their reservation) or
        break the appointment entirely, removing it from the list of available meeting
        times. The middle column is currently blank.</p>

        <p><img src="profhome.png" alt="Professor's Home Screen" title="" /></p>

        <p>Dr. Jablowme clicks on his "Occult Studies" class in the leftmost column. The
        middle column suddenly fills up with a list of demos. Because Dr. Jablowme has
        not yet created a demo for students to demonstrate their ability to create the
        undead, he clicks the "Add Demo" link at the bottom of the middle column. In
        the next screen, he is prompted to name the demo period. He names it "Raising
        Undead." Below the text field asking for his name are two buttons marked
        "Cancel" and "Continue." He clicks the "Continue" button.</p>

        <p>Next, Dr. Jablowme is asked to list times that he is available. There is a
        single text field, to the right of which is a small calendar image that brings
        up a calendar, and to the right of that a button marked "Add." Dr. Jablowme
        remembers that the assignment's due on the 8th of November and likes to get
        started early, so he types in "9 November 2005 2:55 PM" and then hits the
        "Add" button. Now, in an area just below the text box, he sees the text
        "Wednesday, November 9, at 2:55 PM". Oops; Dr. Jablowme always gets totally
        shitfaced on Tuesday. He won't be able to begin grading on Wednesday. He
        clicks a small trash can next to the time, deleting it from his potential
        appointments. He now clicks the calendar widget and selects the 10th of
        November, a Thursday. He clicks Add again, and now a good time is shown. Dr.
        Jablowme repeats the process until he's created nearly a dozen potential
        appointment times.</p>

        <p>On the right side of the screen is a button marked "Cancel," a button marked
        "Go Back," and another marked "Finish." Dr. Jablowme clicks Finish. He is now
        returned to his home screen; a message at the top says, "Appointments
        Created!" Dr. Jablowme smiles serenely, gets up, and returns to his previous
        task of trying to find his eye of newt.</p>

        <h2 id="case_study_larry_putz_mcclanahan">Case Study: Larry Putz McClanahan</h2>

        <p>Larry is fifth-year sophomore at Duke University and a student in Dr.
        Jablowme's course of occult studies. For his Windows-conjuring project, he has
        opted to team up with Samantha Stevens and Genie Nelson. All three of them
        will be demoing at the same time. Because they have not yet made an
        appointment with Dr. Jablowme, Larry sits down at his homebuilt Pentium 9 with
        liquid-oxygen cooling systems, logs into a bootlegged alpha copy of Mac OS XI
        for Intel boxen, and uses his nightly build of Flock to go to
        http://occult.duke.edu/gappy.</p>

        <p>Once logged in, Larry sees a much simpler screen than Dr. Jablowme: in the
        center of the screen is a list of his upcoming demos, along with what class
        they are for, which demo it is, and who his partners are. At the top of the
        list, though, Larry sees in white text on a red background, "You have one
        unscheduled demo. Click here to schedule." He clicks it.</p>

        <p>On the next screen, Larry sees, little to his surprise, that he is setting up
        a demo to show his possessed Windows box. The screen is labeled "Select Group Members." In two columns on the left-side of the screen, the program presents Larry with a list of all people in his class. Larry begins clicking names; as he does so, they form a list on the right side of the screen. At one point, Larry accidentally clicks the name "Micky Mouse." In a red box at the top, the screen suddenly says, "Micky could not be added because he is in another group." Larry sighs, annoyed, but now clicks on the right name. Once he has selected all the members of his group, he clicks the "Next" button.</p>

        <p>Larry now sees a list of open demo slots. He clicks the one he wants and pushes next. He is asked via  JavaScript popup to confirm his selection. He confirms it, after which he is taken back to his home screen. The appointment he just made is now listed, and a moment later, he and all other group members receive an email confirming their appointment.</p>

        <h2 id="licenses">Licenses</h2>

        <p>The license for this project will initially be the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" title="GNU General Public License">GPL</a>, although the fact
        that all copyright holders are trivially available ensures that we can change
        that later in the project if we wish. In particular, we likely want to examine
        at least the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php" title="Berkeley System Design License">BSD</a> license.</p>

        <h2 id="software_architecture">Software Architecture</h2>

        <p>In order to allow us to complete this project in the next month, we will be
        using a Python-based web framework called Django. Django provides (relatively)
        transparent persistence, plus robust user management and administration
        interfaces. These should not be reinvented. The application should also follow
        the rigid model-view-controller (MVC) interface encouraged by Django.</p>

        <p>All remaining architectural decisions are yours. Once you all have come to a
        conclusion, update this specification.</p>

        <h2 id="version_2_features">Version 2 Features</h2>

        <p>The following are features that would be nice to have, but can safely be
        postponed to version two and still leave us with a working, useful product.</p>

        <ol>
        <li>The ability for group members to list their individual schedules and
         set up appointments specific to their individual groups.</li>
        <li>Leveraging the above to provide automatic appointment proposals and
         potentially assignments</li>
        </ol>
